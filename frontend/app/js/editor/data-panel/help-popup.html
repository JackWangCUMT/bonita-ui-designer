                In the scope of a page, form, or layout, a variable can be used to handle business data, or can contain structural information that determines how page elements behave.
            </p>

            <p translate>Create a variable here. Using the variable in a widget property depends on the property value type, described in the page editor general help, in the <i>Properties</i> section.</p>

            <p translate>Available variables types are string and JSON (static), and External API, JavaScript expression, and URL parameter (dynamic).</p>

            <p translate>Variables can be bound to input fields to create conditional behavior between widget properties.</p>

            <p translate>A binding is dynamic, so every time data changes, the whole data model is re-evaluated and the UI is updated.</p>

                When you generate a form from a contract in the Studio, the form contains a Submit button and some default variables: <code>formInput</code>,
                <code>formOutput</code>, <code>taskId</code>, and <code>context</code>
            </p>

            <p translate>
                <code>formInput</code> is a JSON object.
                <br/>Its structure is defined by the contract inputs and the attributes are initialized with default values. It could be used to set initial
                values for form fields.
                <br/>You can set the values in <code>formInput</code> either by editing the default values with constants (useful for test and debug) or with
                values from an object in an external source that has the same model (such as with a BDM external API).
                <br/>You can also set the initial values of a form from some other source without using <code>formInput</code>. However, you will then have to
                edit <code>formOutput</code> manually.
            </p>

            <p translate>
                <code>formOutput</code> is a JavaScript expression returning an object.
                <br/>Its structure matches the contract requirements and is filled with <code>formInput</code> by default. Its goal is to aggregate the fields
                from the form and to submit them to the task or process to fulfil the contract. On Submit, values entered or modified by the end-user and
                aggregated in the <code>formOutput</code> object (as defined by the <i>Data sent on click</i> property of the Submit button) are submitted to
                the process or task
            </p>

            <p translate>
                <code>taskId</code> is a URL Parameter.
                <br/>It is the id of the current BPM task. You can use it as a BPM API parameter.
            </p>

            <p translate><code>context</code> is an External API.
                <br/>It provides references to all business variables and documents in the process instance.
                To retrieve a business variable instance, create an External API variable with value <ng-non-bindable>../{{context.myBusinessData_ref.link}}</ng-non-bindable>
